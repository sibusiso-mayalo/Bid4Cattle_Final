The Nguni is widely acknowledged to be the outstanding beef breed for optimal production under harsh
African conditions. South Africa's indigenous Nguni cattle, long the mainstay of traditional Zulu culture,
are possibly the most beautiful cattle in the world, with their variously patterned and multi-coloured
hides everywhere in demand. These animals have played an important social and economic role in the
development of the Zulu societies. The number of animals held by a village or individual determined
much of their importance to the rest of the world. However, very little records are kept of the cattle, and
most cattle owners tend to hold on to their herd, rather than sell some of them off, especially the young
cattle. Your task is to create a combination web- and mobile-based tool to support the collection and
upkeep of information for current cattle owners. The tool should also provide a platform for the
auctioning of cattle to prospective buyers
